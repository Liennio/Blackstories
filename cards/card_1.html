            <p>The Smith family had buried their deceased rabbit in the garden two days ago. 
                The next day, the neighbour's dog dug up the dead animal and brought it to his owner. </p>
            <p> Of course, the owner immediately thought that his dog had bitten the poor rabbit to death. 
                To keep the accident quiet, the neighbour decided to clean the dead animal and put it back in its cage unnoticed. </p>
