            <h4>How does it work?</h4>
            <p>The basis of the game consists of a Riddlemaster (the one who knows the solution and answers all questions), 
                the Riddle people (the person/s who ask/s the questions) and a black story (the card).</p>
            <p>The principle of black stories is very simple. The Riddlemaster reads the situation on the front of the card out loud 
                or shows the front of the card to the Riddle people.  On the back of the card (click on the card) you can find the solution, 
                which of course keeps the Riddlemaster to him/herself. The Riddle people will now, like real detectives, try to find out 
                what could be the cause of the mysterious, scary or exciting riddle on the card!</p>

            <h4>What questions can you ask?</h4>
            <p>The Riddle people are going to ask questions to solve the mysterious crime. Now comes the biggest challenge! 
                The Riddlemaster may only answer the players' questions with 'yes' or 'no'.</p>
            <p>So the players will have to ask their questions in such a way that they will actually get answers from the Riddlemaster. 
                A question like: "Is it a man or a woman?" will not be answered by the Riddlemaster.</p>

            <h4>Can you give each other hints?</h4>
            <P>Of course, it happens often enough that the Riddle people are completely in the dark. 
                A mild-mannered Riddlemaster will then give a hint. </P>
